# Sequence Data

# Encoding Text

# Bag of Words

# The first and simplest way to encode our data is to use something called bag of words.
# This is a pretty easy technique where each word in a sentence is encoded with an integer and
# thrown into a collection that does not maintain the order of the words but does keep track of the frequency.
# Have a look at the python function below that encodes a string of text into bag of words. 

# Maps word to integer representing it
vocab = {}
word_encoding = 1
def bag_of_words(text):
  global word_encoding

  words = text.lower().split(" ")  # create a list of all of the words in the text, well assume there is no grammar in our text for this example
  bag = {}  # stores all of the encodings and their frequency

  for word in words:
    if word in vocab:
      encoding = vocab[word]  # get encoding from vocab
    else:
      vocab[word] = word_encoding
      encoding = word_encoding
      word_encoding += 1
    
    if encoding in bag:
      bag[encoding] += 1
    else:
      bag[encoding] = 1
  
  return bag

text = "this is a test to see if this test will work is is test a a"
bag = bag_of_words(text)
print(bag)
print(vocab)

# Notice that we've lost the order in which words appear.
# In fact, let's look at how this encoding works for the two sentences we showed above.
positive_review = "I thought the movie was going to be bad but it was actually amazing"
negative_review = "I thought the movie was going to be amazing but it was actually bad"

pos_bag = bag_of_words(positive_review)
neg_bag = bag_of_words(negative_review)

print("Positive:", pos_bag)
print("Negative:", neg_bag)

# Integer Encoding

# The next technique we will look at is called integer encoding.
# This involves representing each word or character in a sentence as a unique integer and maintaining the order of these words.
vocab = {}  
word_encoding = 1
def one_hot_encoding(text):
  global word_encoding

  words = text.lower().split(" ") 
  encoding = []  

  for word in words:
    if word in vocab:
      code = vocab[word]  
      encoding.append(code) 
    else:
      vocab[word] = word_encoding
      encoding.append(word_encoding)
      word_encoding += 1
  
  return encoding

text = "this is a test to see if this test will work is is test a a"
encoding = one_hot_encoding(text)
print(encoding)
print(vocab)

# And now let's have a look at one hot encoding on our movie reviews.
positive_review = "I thought the movie was going to be bad but it was actually amazing"
negative_review = "I thought the movie was going to be amazing but it was actually bad"

pos_encode = one_hot_encoding(positive_review)
neg_encode = one_hot_encoding(negative_review)

print("Positive:", pos_encode)
print("Negative:", neg_encode)
