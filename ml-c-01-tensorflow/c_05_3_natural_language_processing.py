import numpy as np

# Dataset

# For this example, we only need one peice of training data.
# In fact, we can write our own poem or play and pass that to the network for training if we'd like.
# However, to make things easy we'll use an extract from a shakesphere play.
path_to_file = tf.keras.utils.get_file('shakespeare.txt', 'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/shakespeare.txt')

# Loading Your Own Data

# To load your own data, you'll need to upload a file from the dialog below.
# Then you'll need to follow the steps from above but load in this new file instead.

# Since this text isn't encoded yet well need to do that ourselves. We are going to encode each unique character as a different integer.

# Creating Training Examples

# Building the Model

# Creating a Loss Function

# Creating Checkpoints
